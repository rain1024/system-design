# System Design Tutorial Project

Welcome to the System Design Tutorial Project! This hands-on tutorial will walk you through the foundational concepts of system design using a single server architecture. Throughout this guide, you will understand the importance of scalability, fault-tolerance, and efficiency in designing robust systems, even with the constraints of a single server.

Our project uses a single server model to emphasize the core principles of system design, allowing beginners to grasp fundamental ideas before diving into distributed architectures. Each module contains practical exercises, real-world examples, and illustrative diagrams to make complex topics more digestible.

Thank you for choosing our tutorial as your starting point in the vast world of system design. We believe that a strong foundation is crucial, and by mastering the concepts in a simplified environment, you will be better equipped to tackle more complex scenarios in the future. Happy learning!
